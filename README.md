### momentum
![momentum](images/momentumsketch.png?raw=true "momentum")

I initially created 'momentum' as a visual representation of what I was thinking about and feeling at a specific moment in time. I started working on it after coming home from a yoga class during which the teacher asked us to reflect and meditate on what gives us "momentum", meaning what insipires and motivates us to keep moving forward when the going gets tough. 

My sketch began with inspirational quotes because these quotes have given me the motivation that I've needed to overcome challenges throughout my entire life and continue to push me to work hard and accomplish my goals. Even though what constitues a "challenge" in my life has changed, I've also turned to the words of my role models when times become difficult. Reflecting on different stages of my life, I am able to pinpoint a goal or task that I found challenging and the words of one of my role models that helped me overcome the challenge. I was a competitive gymnast from middle school until my senior year of high school, and I remember days that I would come home crying from practice because I was so frustrated in myself and what I perceived as a lack of progress. I remember that the time at which my relationship with the sport of gymnastics was at its worst coincided with the 2012 Olympics in London. I was inspired by all members of the "Fierce Five", the U.S. gymnastics team that year, but especially admired Gabby Douglas. My favorite quote from her got me through frustrations over sprained ankles, difficult competitions, and mental blocks: "The hard days are the best because that's when champions are made." On a different note, I'll also never forget going through my first heartbreak. I was devastated and the pain felt paralyzing. I'll always remember that my broken heart occurred at the same time that I happned to be reading the book string.italics(Eat, Pray, Love) by Elizabeth Gilbert. My favorite quote from this book motivated me to move forward and reminded me that I would soon recover from the pain I was feeling: "You need to learn how to select your thoughts just the same way you select your clothes every day. This is a power you can cultivate. If you want to control things in your life so bad, work on the mind. That's the only thing you should be trying to control." This quote helped me realize that I would not just wake up one morning and feel better, but approaching every day with a positive mentality would help me to eventually feel in control of my thoughts and feelings again.

The three quotes that I have chosen to highlight in my project reflect what I perceive as challenges in my life at the current moment in time. I'm graduating in May, and, although I don't have a set plan yet, I know that I want to go to law school and pursue a public interest career. The reason I want to take this path is because I firmly believe in the words of Martin Luther King Jr., Melinda Gates, and Margaret Mead that I have included in my sketch. I love these three quotes because they all imply that change requires action. Melinda Gates says that we cannot passively hope that things will get better; Martin Luther King Jr. urges us not to passively accept injustice even if it doesn't affect us directly; Margaret Mead reminds us to never hold ourselves back because we think that our small efforts won't make a difference. Currently, the biggest challenge I am facing is uncertainty about the future and what encourages me to keep moving forward are the words of people who insprire me. This is the essence of 'momentum'.

This piece started as something primarily for me. It was a way for me to reflect and consolidate my thoughts. However, my hope is that other people can also be inspired by my work and what it means to me. I know that everyone derives motivation from different sources, but I hope that other people who are inspired by quotes can draw their own motivation and encouragement from my sketch. I chose a light purple color for the backgroung and light green, pink, and yellow colors for the quotes because these colors are calming to me. When I read the quotes, look at the pictures of my role models, and see these colors, I get an overall feeling that everything will be okay. I hope that viewers get this same feeling.  

I created the other elements of this piece, such as "Keep moving forward..." in a forward motion at the top of the sketch, stars in the top lefthand corner, and the interaction with the words "dream", "love", "hope", "believe", and "faith" because they succinctly summarize what this piece means to me. This piece is a reminder for me to keep moving forward on difficult days and to always reach for my highest goals and believe that my dreams will come true. 

I hope that through my representation of my personal "momentum", other people can reflect on what motivates them to overcome challenges. I hope that my piece gets across the message that no two people have the same "momentum" but we all have something that pushes us forward on hard days.


### What is art?

While watching the "What is Art?" videos, I resonated with something that every artist said. Jeff Koons spoke of art as a "vehicle of acceptance". He himself has found that art has helped him develop a sense of self. Wolfgang Laib spoke about how his art reflects the essence of his personal experiences. Laib studied medicine, and he spent years in hospitals, grappling with illness and death. Therefore, he chose to work with pollen to create his art, which he believes symbolizes the beginning of life. Hillary Lloyd explained how she doesn't know exactly what her works are saying and that she's not necessarily trying to document anything with them, but she wants to get the viewer to feel something.

Creating 'momentum' was a helpful exercise in accepting myself, just as Jeff Koons's art is for him. I know that some people find inspirational quotes cliche or silly, but I also know how much these quotes mean to me. I accept that not everyone turns to a list of quotes that they keep on their computer when they have a rough day, but I also accept that this ritual is something that always puts a smile on my face and makes me feel better. I also resonated with what Wolfgang Laib said about art reflecting the essence of experience. As I mentioned above, I am able to pinpoint a goal or task that I found challenging and the words of one of my role models that helped me overcome the challenge at every point in my life. These quotes have been a constant in my life even though particular circumstances have evolved. Laib says that the fact that he has collected the same pollen for 30 years is an important statement in a world that is constantly changing. Like Laib's pollen, inspirational quotes have been a part of my life throughout many changes, and, for this reason, are arguably an essential part of my life experiences. Finally, like Hillary Lloyd, one of my goals is to get the viewer to feel something. I want the viewer to get an overall feeling that everything will be okay and that there's no reason to give up. I also want the viewer to feel inspired to reflect on their own "momentum".

To learn more about how artists approach their work and what art means to people, I watched TED Talks by Aurelia Shimkus and Dustin Yellin. Their approaches are very different but equally fascinating. Aurelia Shimkus starts her talk by saying that we have the wrong notion of art. She says that the goal of art should not be simplicity and beauty - it should not be to entertain us. On the contrary, the goal of art should be to "show us the way to another world," a world to "purify our souls." She says that, through art, we can experience catharsis. She then asks why, if this is in fact the true goal of art, it is so difficult for people to understand abstract music. She answers her question by explaining that in the fast age in which we all live, we don't want to think deeply. She encourages the audience to "find the courage to open your soul to the true works of art." This talk was incredibly inspiring to me. It made me realize that the goal of my art should not be aesthetic perfection but to encourage some level of thought and reflection in the viewer. While I was creating 'momentum', I spent a significant amount of time worrying about if people would think my choices were aesthetically pleasing, but, in the future, I would like to spend less time thinking about this and more time thinking about what thoughts and feelings the viewer will experience when looking at my piece. 

Dustin Yellin is famous for his human artchives, which essentially make a statement about the "boxes we're in." Looking at his art can be uncomfortable, but his message is clear. He hopes that through creating these human archives, he will encourage people to redefine the boxes they're living in. In other words, by putting ourselves into "boxes" and only interacting with people who are similar to us, we are creating an illusion of 'difference' that will only hurt us in the end. Dustin Yellin uses his art to bring people together, and this is something that I would like in explore in future works that I create.
